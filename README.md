# üçµ Tea Tracker  
A **Spotify Wrapped**‚Äìstyle web app for tracking and visualizing your tea consumption habits!

## Why Tea Tracker?  
We‚Äôre active in a niche community of loose leaf tea lovers, where some of us dive deep into **min-maxing** our tea experiences. That includes ranking, scoring, and comparing everything we try, often in big spreadsheets...

## The Vision  
**Tea Tracker** aims to fix that. It‚Äôll be a lightweight web app where tea drinkers can:  
- Upload a CSV/Excel file of their tasting notes  
- Automatically generate visualizations and insights  
- Explore personal tea trends, favorites, and category comparisons

Think of it as **"Tea Wrapped"**‚Äîa personal, data-driven look at your tea journey over time!
