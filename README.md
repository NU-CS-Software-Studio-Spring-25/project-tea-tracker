# 🍵 Tea Tracker  
A **Spotify Wrapped**–style web app for tracking and visualizing your tea consumption habits!

## Why Tea Tracker?  
We’re active in a niche community of loose leaf tea lovers—where some of us dive deep into **min-maxing** our tea experiences. That includes ranking, scoring, and comparing everything we try, often in big spreadsheets...

## The Vision  
**Tea Tracker** aims to fix that. It’ll be a lightweight web app where tea drinkers can:  
- Upload a CSV/Excel file of their tasting notes  
- Automatically generate visualizations and insights  
- Explore personal tea trends, favorites, and category comparisons

Think of it as **"Tea Wrapped"**—a personal, data-driven look at your tea journey over time!

## Minimum (Viable) Valuable Product Features
- Upload CSV/Excel files (4 fields, rank, name, price, category)
- Frontend visualizations 
 - Average price per category
 - Average rank per category
 - Average price for 'rank range' 

## Features (WIP)

- Backend processing of tea ratings and attributes  
- Frontend visualizations (graphs, trend lines, comparisons)  
- Optional account login + saved profiles  
- Feedback loop with early testers from the tea community

A fun way to blend data viz and a shared love of tea 🍵😸
