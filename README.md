# Tea Tracker
My webapp idea is essentially a 'spotify wrapped' for people's tea consumption.

I participate in a lot of niche online communities, and one of them is centered around loose leaf tea. As in any niche community, there is a subset of users that min-max and spreadsheet. As one of the min-maxxers, I've spent way more time than I'd like to admit sorting/ranking everything I've tried, and I noticed some public interest when I posted a spreadsheet with a scoring mechanic that generated graphs for subsets and compared 'enjoyment' scores of different categories with each other (i.e. green tea to black tea). It is extremely primitive in its analysis and data, but I have the 'demo' sheet here

People like these graphs, but find it difficult to make a high-quality database & make the graphs, so I want to make a webapp that lets people get these sorts of insights about their own data, like Spotify Wrapped does. Maybe recommendations/trends?

This would likely involve a csv upload/excel upload to a database, could involve logins.

This would also mean that data has to be processed in some way (back-end stuff) and then displayed in a visually appealing way (front-end).

I do have some potential users already that could give some feedback, but this isn't any sort of highly scalable idea, definitely more of a niche hobby project. There's some interesting potential to use webscrapers to get more data, image scanning to populate the database, a ranking interface, and a lot of other out of scope ideas.
